/**
 * @fileoverview The API spec for the WebChannel messaging library.
 *
 * Similar to HTML5 WebSocket and Closure BrowserChannel, WebChannel
 * offers an abstraction for point-to-point socket-like communication between
 * a browser client and a remote origin.
 *
 * WebChannels are created via <code>WebChannel</code>. Multiple WebChannels
 * may be multiplexed over the same WebChannelTransport, which represents
 * the underlying physical connectivity over standard wire protocols
 * such as HTTP and SPDY.
 *
 * A WebChannels in turn represents a logical communication channel between
 * the client and server end point. A WebChannel remains open for
 * as long as the client or server end-point allows.
 *
 * Messages may be delivered in-order or out-of-order, reliably or unreliably
 * over the same WebChannel. Message delivery guarantees of a WebChannel is
 * to be specified by the application code; and the choice of the
 * underlying wire protocols is completely transparent to the API users.
 *
 * Client-to-client messaging via WebRTC based transport may also be support
 * via the same WebChannel API in future.
 *
 * Note that we have no immediate plan to move this API out of labs. While
 * the implementation is production ready, the API is subject to change
 * (addition only):
 * 1. Adopt new Web APIs (mainly whatwg streams) and goog.net.streams.
 * 2. New programming models for cloud (on the server-side) may require
 *    new APIs to be defined.
 * 3. WebRTC DataChannel alignment
 *

/**
 * A WebChannel represents a logical bi-directional channel over which the
 * client communicates with a remote server that holds the other endpoint
 * of the channel. A WebChannel is always created in the context of a shared
 * {@link WebChannelTransport} instance. It is up to the underlying client-side
 * and server-side implementations to decide how or when multiplexing is
 * to be enabled.

/**
 * Configuration spec for newly created WebChannel instances.
 *
 * WebChannels are configured in the context of the containing
 * {@link WebChannelTransport}. The configuration parameters are specified
 * when a new instance of WebChannel is created via {@link WebChannelTransport}.
 *
 * messageHeaders: custom headers to be added to every message sent to the
 * server. This object is mutable, and custom headers may be changed, removed,
 * or added during the runtime after a channel has been opened.
 *
 * messageUrlParams: custom url query parameters to be added to every message
 * sent to the server. This object is mutable, and custom parameters may be
 * changed, removed or added during the runtime after a channel has been opened.
 *
 * clientProtocolHeaderRequired: whether a special header should be added to
 * each message so that the server can dispatch webchannel messages without
 * knowing the URL path prefix. Defaults to false.
 *
 * concurrentRequestLimit: the maximum number of in-flight HTTP requests allowed
 * when SPDY is enabled. Currently we only detect SPDY in Chrome.
 * This parameter defaults to 10. When SPDY is not enabled, this parameter
 * will have no effect.
 *
 * supportsCrossDomainXhr: setting this to true to allow the use of sub-domains
 * (as configured by the server) to send XHRs with the CORS withCredentials
 * bit set to true.
 *
 * testUrl: the test URL for detecting connectivity during the initial
 * handshake. This parameter defaults to "/<channel_url>/test".
 *
 * sendRawJson: whether to bypass v8 encoding of client-sent messages. Will be
 * deprecated after v9 wire protocol is introduced. Only safe to set if the
 * server is known to support this feature.
 *
 * httpSessionIdParam: the URL parameter name that contains the session id (
 * for sticky routing of HTTP requests). When this param is specified, a server
 * that supports this option will respond with an opaque session id as part of
 * the initial handshake (via the X-HTTP-Session-Id header); and all the
 * subsequent requests will contain the httpSessionIdParam. This option will
 * take precedence over any duplicated parameter specified with
 * messageUrlParams, whose value will be ignored.
