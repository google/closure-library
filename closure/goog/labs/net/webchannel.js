/**
 * @fileoverview The API spec for the WebChannel messaging library.
 *
 * Similar to HTML5 WebSocket and Closure BrowserChannel, WebChannel
 * offers an abstraction for point-to-point socket-like communication between
 * a browser client and a remote origin.
 *
 * WebChannels are created via <code>WebChannel</code>. Multiple WebChannels
 * may be multiplexed over the same WebChannelTransport, which represents
 * the underlying physical connectivity over standard wire protocols
 * such as HTTP and SPDY.
 *
 * A WebChannels in turn represents a logical communication channel between
 * the client and server end point. A WebChannel remains open for
 * as long as the client or server end-point allows.
 *
 * Messages may be delivered in-order or out-of-order, reliably or unreliably
 * over the same WebChannel. Message delivery guarantees of a WebChannel is
 * to be specified by the application code; and the choice of the
 * underlying wire protocols is completely transparent to the API users.
 *
 * Client-to-client messaging via WebRTC based transport may also be support
 * via the same WebChannel API in future.
 *
 * Note that we have no immediate plan to move this API out of labs. While
 * the implementation is production ready, the API is subject to change
 * (addition only):
 * 1. Adopt new Web APIs (mainly whatwg streams) and goog.net.streams.
 * 2. New programming models for cloud (on the server-side) may require
 *    new APIs to be defined.
 * 3. WebRTC DataChannel alignment

/**
 * Configuration spec for newly created WebChannel instances.
 *
 * WebChannels are configured in the context of the containing
 * {@link WebChannelTransport}. The configuration parameters are specified
 * when a new instance of WebChannel is created via {@link WebChannelTransport}.
 *
 * messageHeaders: custom headers to be added to every message sent to the
 * server. This object is mutable, and custom headers may be changed, removed,
 * or added during the runtime after a channel has been opened.
 *
 * initMessageHeaders: similar to messageHeaders, but any custom headers will
 * be sent only once when the channel is opened. Typical usage is to send
 * an auth header to the server, which only checks the auth header at the time
 * when the channel is opened.
 *
 * messageContentType: sent as initMessageHeaders via X-WebChannel-Content-Type,
 * to inform the server the MIME type of WebChannel messages.
 *
 * messageUrlParams: custom url query parameters to be added to every message
 * sent to the server. This object is mutable, and custom parameters may be
 * changed, removed or added during the runtime after a channel has been opened.
 *
 * clientProtocolHeaderRequired: whether a special header should be added to
 * each message so that the server can dispatch webchannel messages without
 * knowing the URL path prefix. Defaults to false.
 *
 * concurrentRequestLimit: the maximum number of in-flight HTTP requests allowed
 * when SPDY is enabled. Currently we only detect SPDY in Chrome.
 * This parameter defaults to 10. When SPDY is not enabled, this parameter
 * will have no effect.
 *
 * supportsCrossDomainXhr: setting this to true to allow the use of sub-domains
 * (as configured by the server) to send XHRs with the CORS withCredentials
 * bit set to true.
 *
 * testUrl: the test URL for detecting connectivity during the initial
 * handshake. This parameter defaults to "/<channel_url>/test".
 *
 * sendRawJson: whether to bypass v8 encoding of client-sent messages. Will be
 * deprecated after v9 wire protocol is introduced. Only safe to set if the
 * server is known to support this feature.
 *
 * httpSessionIdParam: the URL parameter name that contains the session id (
 * for sticky routing of HTTP requests). When this param is specified, a server
 * that supports this option will respond with an opaque session id as part of
 * the initial handshake (via the X-HTTP-Session-Id header); and all the
 * subsequent requests will contain the httpSessionIdParam. This option will
 * take precedence over any duplicated parameter specified with
 * messageUrlParams, whose value will be ignored.
 *
 * httpHeadersOverwriteParam: the URL parameter name to allow custom HTTP
 * headers to be overwritten as a URL param to bypass CORS preflight.
 * goog.net.rpc.HttpCors is used to encode the HTTP headers.
 *
 * backgroundChannelTest: whether to run the channel test (detecting networking
 * conditions) as a background process so the OPEN event will be fired sooner
 * to reduce the initial handshake delay. This option defaults to true.
 * The actual background channel test is not fully implemented.
 *
 * forceLongPolling: whether to force long-polling from client to server.
 * This defaults to false. Long-polling may be necessary when a (MITM) proxy
 * is buffering data sent by the server.
 *
 * fastHandshake: experimental feature to enable true 0-RTT message delivery,
 * e.g. by leveraging QUIC 0-RTT (which requires GET to be used). This option
 * defaults to false. When this option is enabled, backgroundChannelTest will
 * be forced to true. Note it is allowed to send messages before Open event is
 * received, after a channel has been connected. In order to enable 0-RTT,
 * messages need be encoded as part of URL and therefore there needs be a size
 * limit (e.g. 16KB) for messages that need be sent immediately
 * as part of the handshake.
 *
 * disableRedact: whether to disable logging redact. By default, redact is
 * enabled to remove any message payload or user-provided info
 * from closure logs.
 *
 * clientProfile: inform the server about the client profile to enable
 * customized configs that are optimized for certain clients or environments.
 * Currently this information is sent via X-WebChannel-Client-Profile header.
 *
 * internalChannelParams: the internal channel parameter name to allow
 * experimental channel configurations. Supported options include fastfail,
 * baseRetryDelayMs, retryDelaySeedMs, forwardChannelMaxRetries and
 * forwardChannelRequestTimeoutMs. Note that these options are subject to
 * change.
 *
 * xmlHttpFactory: allows the caller to override the factory used to create
 * XMLHttpRequest objects. This is introduced to disable CORS on firefox OS.
 *
 * requestRefreshThresholds: client-side thresholds that decide when to refresh
 * an underlying HTTP request, to limit memory consumption due to XHR buffering
 * or compression context. The client-side thresholds should be signficantly
 * smaller than the server-side thresholds. This allows the client to eliminate
 * any latency introduced by request refreshing, i.e. an RTT window during which
 * messages may be buffered on the server-side. Supported params include
 * totalBytesReceived, totalDurationMs.

 * Network Error
 * 1. By default the webchannel library will set the error status to
 *    NETWORK_ERROR when a channel has to be aborted or closed. NETWORK_ERROR
 *    may be recovered by the application by retrying and opening a new channel.
 * 2. There may be lost messages (not acked by the server) when a channel is
 *    aborted. Currently we don't have a public API to retrieve messages that
 *    are waiting to be acked on the client side. File a bug if you think it
 *    is useful to expose such an API.
 * 3. Details of why a channel fails are available via closure debug logs,
 *    and stats events (see webchannel/requeststats.js). Those are internal
 *    stats and are subject to change. File a bug if you think it's useful to
 *    version and expose such stats as part of the WebChannel API.
 *
 * Server Error
 * 1. SERVER_ERROR is intended to indicate a non-recoverable condition, e.g.
 *    when auth fails.
 * 2. We don't currently generate any such errors, because most of the time
 *    it's the responsibility of upper-layer frameworks or the application
 *    itself to indicate to the client why a webchannel has been failed
 *    by the server.
 * 3. When a channel is failed by the server explicitly, we still signal
 *    NETWORK_ERROR to the client. Explicit server failure may happen when the
 *    server does a fail-over, or becomes overloaded, or conducts a forced
 *    shutdown etc.
 * 4. We use some heuristic to decide if the network (aka cloud) is down
 *    v.s. the actual server is down.
 *
 *  RuntimeProperties.getLastStatusCode is a useful state that we expose to
 *  the client to indicate the HTTP response status code of the last HTTP
 *  request initiated by the WebChannel client library, for debugging
 *  purposes only.
