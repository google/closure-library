JavaScript implementation of the safe-HTML types. These types are simple
wrappers around string, and represent values that are known -- by construction
or via escaping or sanitization -- to be safe to use in various HTML contexts
and with various DOM APIs.

See http://go/safehtmltypes for an introduction to the safe-HTML types.

See http://go/safehtml-closure for design doc for the Closure implementation.
