  <h1>goog.ui.AutoComplete</h1>

  Google Buzzwords:<br>

    This data is being pulled from the server at
    <a href="autocompleteremotedata.js">autocompleteremotedata.js</a>.
  </p>

    Ideally the server would perform a search on the query and would only
    return relevant results; however, this response is static.
